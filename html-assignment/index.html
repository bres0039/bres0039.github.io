            <h3>About me</h3>
                 <p class="indented">My name is Dielleza Bresilla. I am from Kosovo and I moved to Canada six years ago. I have worked very hard to reach this point in my life. The journey has been challenging, but it has also given me many interesting and valuable experiences</p>

                 <p>I chose to apply for <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> because I have a naturale passion for photography and desing. I have always admired people with experience in this filed, and I hope to learn new tools and techniques that will help me work with more confidence, especially in web desing.</p>
